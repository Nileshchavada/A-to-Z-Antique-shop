    <descreption>The style of this would be in my opinion one of the last items made as Waring being a standalone company. As all things made by Warings, quality was the number 1 priority and that came above price. This bookcase just oozes premium work from the choice of timber to the quality of the cast brass handles and the door bolts, and of course the fantastic cabinet work.

    <Category>Furniture</Category>
    <descreption>An exceptionally rare and high quality dining suite, this was designed by Robin Day and made by Hille in the 1950-60’s. The chairs are all upholstered in cream leather with ebonised wooden legs. They are all in great condition, with only some extremely minor wear. The leather has no rips or tears, it’s all beautifully soft. They may have been re-upholstered at some point. The table has a mahogany top and ebonised wooden legs, there is an extending leaf that unfolds from beneath the top when you slide it apart. We have had the table stripped and re-polished to a very high standard, it’s also in superb condition throughout.

    <descreption>This is a magnificent Edwardian bookcase made from solid and veneered rosewood. Of large proportions at over 10 1/2 foot long but not particularly tall for it's length at 6'9 foot. The quality of the piece is outstanding with every effort gone into the construction. There are labels for Harrods on the bookcase which possibly means they had it as a showcase, it would explain the efforts gone into the bookcase and possibly the size. The glazed doors, top and bottom feature the central glass to be bevelled, which enhances the aesthetics although this is easier to see in person. The lower centre doors are crisply carved with urns, foliage and flowers. All the drawers are lined in solid mahogany and the original brass handles have strong Aesthetic movement overtones in their design. Condition is very good and the bookcase breaks down into a number of pieces for transportation.

    <descreption>This is a joyful set of pottery teapots (20) and jugs (4)  displayed on a simply designed but very elegant 19th century pine dresser. 

Each of the teapots shown, has its own story, each was a gift celebrating a life event and even love for lucky recipients. Whilst naïve they are so cheery and this decorative dresser set will bring joy to its new home wherever that home may be. There are 20 teapots, including a very rare twin spouted pot and 4 jugs of different sizes. The set generally is in very good condition, some teapots do show wear commensurate with age and one is missing a lid. All of the pottery retains its integrity. This set includes the most spectacular immense teapots, some approaching 16" and holding half a gallon of tea! These pots were surmounted by another little teapot in the form of a knob to the lid.

It strikes the hours on a bell and unusually once on the half hour . It has a pull repeat and strike silent facility in the arch. The inverted bell top case has gilt brass edged glazed sides and doors which allow the movement to be clearly seen . There are caryatids to all four canted corners and pierced sound fretts front and rear . The extensive use of applied gilt brass on all sides indicate that the clock was made to be displayed in the centre of a room or in front of a mirror . It is a very impressive item indeed . The 7 inch arched silvered brass chapter ring and spandrel dial has a beautifully matted centre with false pendulum aperture and the makers name attached on a plate . The strike silent dial is in the arch and a calendar aperture above 6 o'clock . The pierced steel hands are original. The clock is imperfect working order As can be seen from the images this clock is in excellent condition throughout and is ready to be displayed in the home.The ebonised case has developed a lovely warm colour over the years and shows the fruit wood base veneer in parts giving it a wonderful patina.</descreption>
